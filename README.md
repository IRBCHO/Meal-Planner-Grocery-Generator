🥗 Meal Planner & Grocery Generator
by Benchaphorn (Irene) Cho

A Python desktop application built with Tkinter that helps users plan meals for a full week (3 meals per day), calculates cost and calories, generates a grocery list, suggests healthy snacks, saves favorite meals, and optionally opens a recipe website for more ideas.

This project demonstrates GUI development, file handling, data structures, randomization, and user-driven workflow design — perfect for showcasing early software development skills.
